# StudyXR


## About

StudyXR is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the conduct of user studies in immersive environments (VR, AR, and MR). As an extension of the StudyVR framework, StudyXR addresses several challenges in immersive research including specialized equipment requirements, complex coding, and data management.

## Features

- **Easy Study Management**: Create and implement studies with approved methodologies and any type of stimuli. Managed by StudyManager in Inspector.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simplified UI with minimal learning curve for researchers and participants.
- **Versatile Data Collection**: Seamless integration with various data collection platforms. Survey displayed by just pasting the link to StudyManager.
- **Cross-Platform XR Deployment**: Easy deployment across VR, AR, and MR platforms with minimal reconfiguration.
- **MR System Support**: Passthrough capabilities.
- **Real-time Lighting**: Generate realistic illumination and dynamic shadows in mixed reality. Lighting is managed in configuration panel. (Press & Hold: Left & Right Stick for 3 seconds) Researchers are free to add multiple lighting sources and modify various lighting configurations to achieve good alignment.
- **Session Record & Replay**: Records the whole study session with customizable recording rates and objects. Generates organized csv files for replay and further data analysis. Session Player replays the saved recording by one click.
- **Streamlined Configuration**: Concise configuration panel integrated into Unity's inspector.

## Technical Highlights

- Built using Meta MR Utility Kit for blending virtual objects with the real world
